# Responsive E-commerce site

by Anojan Santhakumar

## Description

This project is a simple e-commerce platform for purchasing furniture items. It consists of three main pages: a start page showcasing products as cards, individual product pages and a shopping cart page. The site is built using vanilla HTML and CSS for layout and styling, with JavaScript used to dynamically load content and manage user interactions.

## Features

- Product Showcase: The start page features a grid of product cards, showcasing various furniture items available for purchase. Each card displays the product image, name and price.

- Individual Product Pages: Clicking on a product card navigates the user to an individual product page, where they can view detailed information about the selected product, including image, descriptions and pricing.

- Shopping Cart: Users can add products to their shopping cart directly from the individual product pages. The shopping cart page displays a summary of the items added, allowing users to review their selections before proceeding to checkout.

- Responsive Design: The website is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless user experience across different devices and screen sizes.
